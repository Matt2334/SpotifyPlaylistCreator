# SpotifyPlaylistCreator
Have you ever wanted to listen to your Liked Spotify songs from different account but when looking for it, no search results come up? 
This playlist is considered private and I have yet to find a way to simply make it public. 
By entering your Client ID and Client Secret into this code and running it, the script will take all of your Liked Songs and create a new playlist. 
Furthermore, you will be prompted with a choice to make the playlist public or private. And by rerunning the code, the playlist will update with all the added songs  



## So How does it work?
In this script we use the Spotify API and the Python Spotify API framework Spotipy. 
By using Spotipy, you are given the ability to access spotify data. You can even look up songs.
